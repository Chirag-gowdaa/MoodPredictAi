Project Idea: "MoodBoardAI – A Vibe-Based Content Generator"
Concept:
A platform where users select their current mood (e.g., chill, productive, sad, focused) and the app generates a customized vibe page with:

Lo-fi music or Spotify playlist embed

A matching color theme

Inspirational quotes

YouTube video recommendations

AI-generated art or wallpaper (optional)

Core Features:
Mood Selector (dropdown or cards: chill, angry, study-mode, etc.)

Auto-generated Page with:

Lo-fi/Spotify embeds

Quotes from a DB or API

Random wallpapers (Unsplash API or pre-seeded)

YouTube suggestions based on vibe

User Accounts (save favorite vibe pages or create custom ones)

Dark/Light mode toggle

"Surprise Me" Button that creates a completely random mood page

Tech Stack Fit:
Frontend: HTML + TailwindCSS + EJS (for dynamic vibe pages)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB (for saved moods, quotes, user favorites)

Bonus Add-ons:

Spotify API (for real music playlists)

Unsplash API (for wallpapers)

Optional OpenAI integration for quotes or mini mood descriptions

Why This Stands Out:
Combines aesthetics + tech (perfect if you want to transition into content creation too)

Feels personalized – not a generic CRUD app

You can literally show it off as a “vibe page generator” that blends utility + creativity

Great for expanding into a progressive web app (PWA) later
